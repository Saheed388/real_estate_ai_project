Marketing description (ready to paste)
Rare opportunity in Ikoyi's sought‑after Mojisola Onikoyi Estate: a well‑located block of seven spacious 3‑bedroom flats on a 1,004 sqm freehold plot with attractive resident amenities including a pool and gym. The property is held on a Lagos C of O and presents an excellent acquisition for investors seeking immediate rental income or owner‑occupiers looking for a turnkey, premium residential investment in one of Lagos's most prestigious neighbourhoods.

This asset benefits from Ikoyi's strong rental demand, secure estate environment, and proximity to corporate nodes, embassies, premium schools and lifestyle destinations. The block is suitable for a buy‑and‑hold rental strategy, a reposition-and-resell play, or conversion/upgrade to an upscale serviced apartment offering.

Investment highlights

- Prime Ikoyi location: high demand for quality 3‑bedroom units from corporate tenants, expatriates and high‑net‑worth households.
- Ready rental income stream (tenant roll or vacant possession options to be confirmed).
- Attractive amenities (pool and gym) that support premium rent and high occupancy.
- Clear Lagos C of O --- facilitates a smooth transaction and mortgage/financing options.
- Compact, efficient plot allowing for future redevelopment or expansion (subject to approvals) if buyer desires higher density or value‑add works.
- Strong long‑term capital appreciation potential given Ikoyi's limited supply of quality residential stock.

Action: obtain current market rent comparables to produce an accurate yield and cash‑flow model. Consider operational costs, management fees, taxes and vacancy when calculating net yield.

Condition & technical notes

- Building condition, tenancy status and date of last renovation: to be confirmed (photos and inspection recommended).
- Number of parking bays, backup power arrangement (generator/inverter), water source (borehole/estate supply) and waste management setup: confirm on request.
- Any proposed redevelopment or change of use requires approval from Lagos State and local planning authorities.

Documents & due diligence

- Lagos C of O (title) --- available for verification to qualified buyers under NDA.
- Building plans / approved layout (if available) --- request for inspection.
- Tenancy schedules / rental roll (if tenanted) --- available on request for qualified parties.
- Site survey, as‑built drawings and utility connection details --- to be provided if available.
- Recommended: technical inspection (structural & services), fire & safety compliance check, and legal title search prior to commitment.

Process (concise)

1. Submit proof of funds / buyer profile and intent (purchase, refinance, JV).
2. NDA & baseline document pack issued to qualified buyers.
3. Arrange site inspection by appointment and technical walkthrough.
4. Submit offer; negotiate Heads of Terms and deposit conditions.
